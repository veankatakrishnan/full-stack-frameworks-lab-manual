## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **React 19.2.0** - Modern UI library
- **Vite 7.2.4** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Programming language
- **CSS3** - Styling with modern features
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting and deployment
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

All experiments follow a consistent design language:
- Clean, minimal aesthetic with light gray backgrounds
- White cards with subtle shadows for depth
- Blue accent color (#3498db) for interactive elements
- System fonts (Segoe UI) for optimal readability
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## 💻 Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Running an Experiment Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/veankatakrishnan/full-stack-frameworks-lab-manual.git
cd full-stack-frameworks-lab-manual
```

2. Navigate to any experiment:
```bash
cd expt-01  # or expt-02, expt-03, expt-04, expt-05
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
